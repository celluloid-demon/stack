# This is an advanced setup which starts both the IPv4 and the IPv6 Kea DHCP
# services, along with the Control Agent service that can forward HTTP API
# requests to the relevant locations.
# The REST API will be available on port 8000 on the localhost address.
# !! ------------------------------------------------------------------------ !!
# Both of the DHCP services use the 'host' network so they may actually serve
# real leases. Docker does not handle routing of IPv6 by default, so it is the
# only option for that container unless you reconfiger the Docker daemon.
