__On modded servers:__

Ok, so there are two major types of modifications that can be made to Minecraft: generally referred to as "plugins" and "mods".

Plugins refer to server-only modifications and run on servers such as CraftBukkit and Spigot. Plugins are limited in what they can do because they have to work with the vanilla client (but that is also their advantage: players don't have to install anything to join these servers).

Mods, on the other hand, generally refer to modifications to both the client and server, and use mod loaders such as Minecraft Forge or Fabric (server-side mods do exist but I'm going to gloss over that for the sake of simplicity). Mods are capable of changing the game in ways plugins never could - adding custom items, blocks, mechanics, machines, mobs, etc - you name it and a mod can probably do it.

With that out of the way: This subreddit deals with mods, not plugins, so I will only be referring to mods from here on out.

If you are new to modding, I recommend using a "modpack". Modpacks come with a group of mods that are pre-configured in a way that is typically balanced and fun to play. Popular websites for hosting modpacks include Curseforge and FTB.

For your first playthrough, I recommend playing a so-called "kitchen sink" modpack. These modpacks, as the name implies, include a little bit of everything and can be useful for learning the basics of modded Minecraft and figuring out what style of play you like best.

For a specific recommendation, it's a little old and runs on Minecraft 1.12.2, but I've never gone wrong with recommending a newbie Enigmatica 2. It includes a wide variety of popular mods and extensive quests to guide you along the path. For downloading and installing modpacks the Curseforge launcher works but is kinda shitty, I recommend instead using PolyMC which is much less painful to use in my opinion and supports downloading modpacks from several popular websites including Curseforge.

For you as the sysadmin, most modpacks include a sever pack, which is generally as easy to use as downloading, extracting, and running some script to start the server. You're probably aware of this if you've run a vanilla server before but you need to open port 25565 in your firewall (that's the port MC uses).

Good luck and feel free to comment any other questions you have!
